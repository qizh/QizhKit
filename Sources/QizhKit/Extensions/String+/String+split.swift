	/// Splits the string into chunks to accommodate a specified maximum length,
	/// considering line breaks as the preferred splitting points.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - maxLength: The maximum length of each output chunk. The default value is 1024.
	/// - Returns: An array of `Substring` chunks.
	///
	/// - Note: The function iterates through the original string and creates chunks of text
	///         based on the specified maximum length. If a line break character (`\n`) is
	///         found within the chunk, the split occurs at the line break. If no line break
	///         character is present, the function tries to split at the last space character
	///         before the maxLength. If no space is found, the chunk is split at the
	///         maxLength. The line break character or space character (if used for
	///         splitting) is dropped from the output.
	///
	/// - Complexity: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of characters
	/// 		in the string.
	///               The function iterates through the string once to create the chunks.
