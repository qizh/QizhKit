# I have checked `Package.resolved` into source control, not ignored it. Here's why:
# 	1.	Reproducible, deterministic builds
# 	2.	Reliable CI/CD workflows
# 	3.	Auditable dependency changes
# /Package.resolved


# keep .swiftpm (so Package.resolved and shared schemes stay in the repo)
# but ignore only the user-specific subfolder:
.swiftpm/xcode/xcuserdata/
